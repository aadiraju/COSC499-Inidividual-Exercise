# COSC499 Inidividual Github Exercise - Abhineeth Adiraju
This repository is for the COSC499 Inidividual Github Exercise to showcase my ability to use Github and the Git workflow.

The program is a simple script in python that deals wth sorting lists.

## Methods Included:
### `sort_int_list(array: [int]) -> [int]`:
This method sorts an integer array using bubble sort method. To run this feature simply execute `SortScript.py` and it will run the method with a sample value.
It also has tests located in `SortTests.py`, and tests are executed by running that file.
